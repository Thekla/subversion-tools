OpenSSL version
For some reason, I can't figure out how to make the Linux runtime linker find a
local copy of libcrypto.so.1.1 to satisfy libssl.so.1.1's requirements. One can
get around this by specifying LD_PRELOAD or whatever, but this is a major
let down to those wanting to ship complete software. For now, we are reverting
to OpenSSL 1.1.0 instead of 1.1.0i in order to have greater compatibility
with whatever version of libcrypto.so the runtime linker happens to find, sigh.
